# Godot Every Day

> I am going to be teaching with Godot, Raspberry Pi, and Meta Quest over the next 10–24 years! So let’s dive in, relearn, and craft a little bit of code every day.

I am a Unity3D game developer who has spent 14 years having fun with game jams, hackathons, personal projects, and client work.

It’s really hard for me to restart on Godot and relearn every step of the way.
But here’s the magic: Godot runs directly on the Quest, on Raspberry Pi, and even on Android phones!

It’s a true “plug-and-code” engine—perfect for teaching coding and IT through video games.

To push myself forward, I bought 12 Raspberry Pi 5 with screens and keyboards to teach coding around Belgium and at hackathons.

So now, there’s only one way to go:

Create **eSports coding tournaments** through games with APInt.IO, using Godot as the foundation to teach coding in a fun and competitive way.
Let’s learn some code a bit every day!

I also created a YouTube channel:
👉 [https://www.youtube.com/@HelloGodotPi](https://www.youtube.com/@HelloGodotPi)

My goal is to make short **“Step:” videos** without audio that show the key steps you need to learn.

I’ll explain these steps in detail on my teaching channel (in French):
👉 [https://www.youtube.com/@EloiTeaching](https://www.youtube.com/@EloiTeaching)

Once the channels grow enough to unlock audio subtitles, I’ll add audio commentary in both French and English.

# Note for me on the way

## To do next
- List all the reserved keyword of GDScript in the https://github.com/EloiStree/HelloGodotCode
- Make a parsing list of all the topic I use to teach in Unity3D / C# to fill with Godot alternative.
