I fell on the ARduino Uno Q live stream of SMARS Q project of Kevin McAleer.
As it is a version of what I did with skid steering.

I wanted to explore if I can make a Godot version of it.  
If I can find the STL.

In the end, I started to setup the 3D nodes and vibe a bit on the code from my Unity code to Godot with Chat Gpt.|
I have to correct the when I have a clear mind
