I am going in a hackathon where I want to explore the API of the sponsor in Godot.
To do so I want to make before and after the hackathon a small artillery dos game.

3D Map take too much space and require server or API. 

So I suppose I will have to download elevator API and install it on local PC for tournament.
And generate gride of point around the hit target.

For now, what I can explore is the same feature as Fusion 360.

Take some 2D map image, give them two gps point with the distance between them to compute rough estimation of in game shoot.
Also, it would allows to generate 2D color image of a battle zone from the sponsor API then use compute shader and Texture2D to work on it.
