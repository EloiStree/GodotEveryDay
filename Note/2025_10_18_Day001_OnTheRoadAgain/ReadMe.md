OK, I fail to do it every day, so I go back to day 1.

Let’s just try to write some “Hello World” GDScript in a package that can be used as a cheatsheet.

I created a checklist for the package while repracticing it:
🔗 [Checklist.md](https://github.com/EloiStree/HelloGodotAssetLibrary/blob/main/Checklist.md)

I also started a list of what to learn in Godot here:
🔗 [2025_10_18_gdp_hello_godot_script](https://github.com/EloiStree/2025_10_18_gdp_hello_godot_script)

I added the reserved keywords of Godot, to be filled in one by one as a way to train.

For tomorrow:
Reserve keyword: https://github.com/EloiStree/HelloGodotCode/issues/22  
`If` https://github.com/EloiStree/HelloGodotCode/issues/45  
Operator: https://github.com/EloiStree/HelloGodotCode/issues/23
