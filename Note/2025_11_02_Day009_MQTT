I looked a bit at https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/1993

So I tried to see what can be do with a Pi 5 and a server on the write limitation and client information.

But MQTT dont seem to give enough control an who is talking to the channel.

So to read it is a good idea, but to write... Hum not great.
