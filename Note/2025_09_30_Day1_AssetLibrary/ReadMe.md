The thing I really loved in Unity3D is the package manager.

Something I really disliked about it, though, is that instead of providing a server to the community—like **crate.io** in Rust or **NPM** in JavaScript—Unity created their own and then just gave us the tools to host packages ourselves.

But in Godot, we have something called the **Asset Library**, which is the equivalent:
[https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset)

So let’s explore what it is and what it allows us to do.

**Minimal Goal:** Make a Hello World package with just a print hello world in it.
