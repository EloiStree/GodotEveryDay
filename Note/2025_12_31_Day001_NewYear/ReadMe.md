New year is here. I abused of Arc Raiders.
But know I need to focus on what I was going to:
Make code tournament on games.

Starting by 10 Seconds Ninja and Silksong.

I have the opportunity to teach Godot XR in some month.
So I also need to focus on that.

For now I need to be sure to have a Pico Keyboard input and a ESP32 XInput Gamepad.
I will need to have a Pico to XInput Leonardo. But that not the priority in the planning.


Today, I started to reopen the code of the Pico and reopen the Godot Intractable index integer.
