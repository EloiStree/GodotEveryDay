The new year is here. I spent too much time on *Arc Raiders*, but now I need to refocus on what I planned to do:
**make code tournaments for games**.

I’ll start with **10 Seconds Ninja** and **Silksong**.

I also have the opportunity to teach **Godot XR** in a few months, so I need to focus on that as well.

For now, I need to make sure I have:

* a **Pico keyboard input**, and
* an **ESP32 XInput gamepad**.

Eventually, I will need a **Pico-to-XInput (Leonardo-style) adapter**, but that is not a priority in the planning.

Today, I started reopening the **Pico code** and revisiting the **Godot interactable index integer**.
