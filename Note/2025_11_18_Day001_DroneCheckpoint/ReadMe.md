Yep 23 days in a row was fun but I had a day of weakness on Midnight and tasks to do.

I want to target on organising Tournament and next workshop is some drones for kids to learn Godot.

So I started to code the single player check point to make 10 Seconds Ninja kind of game in a Drone Godot style.
