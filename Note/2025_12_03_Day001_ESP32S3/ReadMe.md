I was afk learning how to make a wow private server and trying to recover hardware code of the past.

-----------


I try to do an Pico2W Keyboard, Mouse and Gamepad.
But gamepad are not XInput.
So I wanted to redo my Arduino HC06 and UART Linked it.

Then I realized... ESP32S3 could give me Wifi and Bluetooth.
So I did a IID S2W ESP32S3 XInput gamepad for Window ;)

I had to tested it, so I took an old testing code of Unity3D:
https://github.com/EloiStree/2025_05_29_XInputFourDroneDebug

Then did a Godot package to test all that:
https://github.com/EloiStree/2025_12_03_gdp_interactable_index_integer


You can find the code here:

I am going to do the 1800000000 and 1700000000 tomorrow in Godot to be use with student
In Wow int
